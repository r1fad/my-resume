            \item Driving the development of a \textbf{Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system} as a \textbf{founding engineer}, leveraging \textbf{Rust, Delta-rs, and Datafusion} to process over \textbf{1 Million records per second}, enhancing Cloudflare customers' ability to monitor and respond to security threats in real-time.
            \item \textbf{Spearheaded the complex integration} of \textbf{SIEM queries} with Kirby, an internal distributed query engine, \textbf{collaborating cross-functionally} to achieve \textbf{substantial query performance gains}; \textbf{developed sophisticated logic} to publish compacted Parquet files to Kirby and intelligently route SQL queries between Delta Lake and Kirby based on timestamps, resulting in a \textbf{100\% to 4000\% reduction in query times}.
            \item \textbf{Proposed and implemented} a \textbf{robust buffer flushing mechanism} for \textbf{SIEM ingestion pods}, \textbf{eliminating data loss} during pod failures and significantly enhancing \textbf{data integrity} and \textbf{reliability}.
            \item \textbf{Led the architectural decomposition} of \textbf{SIEM pods} into \textbf{distinct ingestion and API services}, isolating high-load ingestion processes from critical API operations and preventing expensive queries from impacting data ingestion throughput.
            \item \textbf{Led the integration} of \textbf{Zero Trust logs} into the SIEM, addressing a \textbf{major customer demand} and driving \textbf{adoption} during the product's beta phase.
            \item \textbf{Developed a system} to track and calculate \textbf{ingested bytes of logs per customer} in the SIEM, enabling \textbf{accurate usage-based and data retention billing}, transforming the product into a \textbf{revenue-generating solution}.
            \item \textbf{Contributed to open-source development} by raising and resolving issues in the \textbf{Delta-rs crate}, enhancing its functionality to support \textbf{efficient log management and querying} within the SIEM.
